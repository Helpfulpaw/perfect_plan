# Perfect Plan Repository

This repository houses planning documents and utilities for the **Waterfall-Docs-Repo** project.
The main checklist lives in [docs/planning/PROJECT_PLAN.md](docs/planning/PROJECT_PLAN.md).

For new projects, start from the [Project Plan Template](docs/planning/PROJECT_PLAN_TEMPLATE.md)
and see [PROJECT_PLAN_PROMPT.md](docs/planning/PROJECT_PLAN_PROMPT.md) for the prompt
that generated the current plan.

Role prompts are documented in [docs/ROLES_PROMPTS.md](docs/ROLES_PROMPTS.md).
Review processes are outlined in [process/PROCESS_TEMPLATE.md](process/PROCESS_TEMPLATE.md),
and dialog transcripts reside in the `tasks/` directory.
