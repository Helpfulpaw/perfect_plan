# Perfect Plan Repository

This repository houses planning documents for the Waterfall-Docs-Repo project. The main checklist lives in [docs/planning/PROJECT_PLAN.md](docs/planning/PROJECT_PLAN.md).

For new projects, start from the [Project Plan Template](docs/planning/PROJECT_PLAN_TEMPLATE.md) and see [PROJECT_PLAN_PROMPT.md](docs/planning/PROJECT_PLAN_PROMPT.md) for the prompt that generated the current plan.

Role prompts are documented in [docs/ROLES_PROMPTS.md](docs/ROLES_PROMPTS.md). Review processes are outlined in [process/PROCESS_TEMPLATE.md](process/PROCESS_TEMPLATE.md), and dialog transcripts reside in the `tasks/` directory.
