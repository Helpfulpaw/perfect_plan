# Execute Task Process

Follow these steps whenever you work on an existing task.

1. Open `docs/planning/PROJECT_PLAN.md` to locate the next task marked `Pending`.
   You can run `python src/random_task.py` to select a random unblocked task.
2. Note the Responsible Role and Reviewer Roles listed for that task.
3. Read the matching prompts in `docs/ROLES_PROMPTS.md`.
4. Navigate to `tasks/task_XX/` where `XX` is the task number.
5. Record dialog and decisions in `README.md` and update `followups.md` with any
   dependencies or follow-up items.
6. Use the checklist in `process/PROCESS_TEMPLATE.md` when reviewing work.
7. Commit changes that satisfy the task's Definition of Done.
8. Append any lessons learned to `AGENTS.md` under **Lessons Learned**.
