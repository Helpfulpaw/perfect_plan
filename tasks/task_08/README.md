## Review for Task 8
**Responsible:** QA Lead
**Reviewer:** Support Lead

### Task Description
Write QA Test Plan & test cases (`docs/TEST_PLAN.md`, `docs/TEST_CASES.md`). Documents exist, pass `testplan_linter`; traceability matrix links each requirement to at least one test case.

### Review Notes
- **Clarity:** The task requires creating two testing documents and ensuring they are lint-clean.
- **Blockers:** Example artifacts from Task 4 are not yet available, so test coverage is limited to current templates and scripts.
- **Resources:** `docs/ROLES_PROMPTS.md`, `process/EXECUTE_TASK.md`, `linters/testplan_linter.py`.
