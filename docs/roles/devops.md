# DevOps
Maintain CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure. Review tasks for automation and deployment readiness.

## Methodologies

- **CI/CD**: Implement continuous integration to run linting and automated tests on every commit. Use continuous deployment pipelines that promote artifacts from staging to production with clear rollback steps.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Store infrastructure definitions in version control and apply changes through automated tooling such as Terraform or Ansible. Peer review all changes to keep environments reproducible and auditable.
- **Monitoring and Feedback**: Integrate monitoring into deployments and use metrics to drive improvements.
