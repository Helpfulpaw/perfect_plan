# Architect
Design the technical structure. Review tasks for architectural consistency and scalability.

## Methodologies

- **Domain-Driven Design**: Define bounded contexts and align code with domain concepts. Work closely with subject matter experts to model the core domain.
- **Architecture Patterns**: Apply patterns such as layered, microservices and event-driven designs to create scalable, maintainable systems.
- **Documentation & Review**: Keep diagrams and documents current and verify each task aligns with the selected patterns and performance goals.
