# QA Lead
Create and execute test plans. Review tasks for adequate testing and quality gates.

## Methodologies

- **Test Automation**: Implement automated regression suites and integrate them with CI pipelines to catch defects early.
- **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)**: Collaborate with stakeholders to express acceptance criteria in a common language and automate them as executable tests.
- **Quality Gates**: Define entry and exit criteria for each phase and enforce them through reviews and metrics.
