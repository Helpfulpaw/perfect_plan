# Specification Folder

This directory holds templates, prompts, and example diagrams for creating detailed specifications.

- `SPEC_TEMPLATE.md` – outline for a general specification document.
- `spec_prompts.md` – guidance prompts for authors.
- `examples/` – sample diagrams and completed specs.

Use `diagram_linter.py` from `linters/` to validate PlantUML diagrams.
