# Research Retrospective on Redundant Steps

This document summarizes redundant steps discovered while building the repository and records lessons learned for future planning.

## Methodology
- Reviewed `docs/planning/PROJECT_PLAN.md` and all task dialogs.
- Compared each task objective against existing deliverables.

## Findings
- Some early documentation tasks repeated reviews of the same files.
- Template creation was performed more than once before consolidation.
- Linter setup overlapped with documentation updates.

## Lessons Learned
- Assign clear ownership of documents to prevent duplicate work.
- Combine review stages when feasible.
- Update the project plan whenever tasks are merged or removed.
