# Architecture Folder

This directory stores architecture templates, prompts, and example diagrams.

- `ARCHITECTURE_TEMPLATE.md` – outline for general architecture documents.
- `arch_prompts.md` – guidance prompts for design activities.
- `examples/` – sample diagrams showing component relationships.

Use `architecture_linter.py` from `linters/` to validate PlantUML diagrams.
