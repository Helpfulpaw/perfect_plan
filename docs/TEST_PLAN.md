# Test Plan

## Introduction
This document outlines the testing approach for the Perfect Plan repository.

## Test Items
- Documentation templates
- Linter scripts
- Example artifacts

## Features Not Tested
- External integrations such as metrics push
- Graphical dashboards

## Approach
Testing focuses on unit tests for Python utilities and linting rules for documentation. Each document is validated with the appropriate linter and automated tests are executed with pytest.

## Pass/Fail Criteria
All linters and unit tests must complete with no errors.

## Test Deliverables
- Individual test cases in `docs/TEST_CASES.md`
- CI run results and pytest reports

## Schedule
Tests run automatically on each pull request through the CI workflows.

## Risks
Delayed implementation of metrics scripts may reduce coverage for monitoring features.
