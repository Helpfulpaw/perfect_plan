# Agent Instructions

The repository defines two processes: executing an existing task or creating a
new one.

## Execute a Task
If the request is to **execute a task**, run `python src/random_task.py` to select a pending task. The script prints the responsible role's prompt and the contents of `process/EXECUTE_TASK.md`.

## Create a Task
If the request is to **create a task**, follow `process/CREATE_TASK.md` to add
it to the project plan and create its folder.

- Work on one task at a time.

## Reflect on the Work
After completing a task:
1. Add a bullet under **Lessons Learned** summarizing what to repeat or avoid.
2. Update relevant process docs if a new step is required.
